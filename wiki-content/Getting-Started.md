# Getting Started

Welcome to StoryGrind! This guide will walk you through creating your first project and running your first editing tool.

## üéØ Before You Begin

Make sure you have:
- ‚úÖ [Installed StoryGrind](Installation-Guide)
- ‚úÖ [Set up your API key](API-Setup-Guide) (for AI tools)
- ‚úÖ A manuscript file (.txt or .docx format)

## üìÅ Understanding Projects

StoryGrind organizes your work into **projects**. Each project:
- Gets its own folder in `~/writing_with_storygrind/`
- Contains your manuscript files
- Stores all analysis and editing results
- Keeps everything organized with timestamps

Think of a project as a workspace for one book, story collection, or writing project.

## üÜï Creating Your First Project

### Step 1: Launch StoryGrind
- Open StoryGrind from your Applications folder (Mac) or Start menu (Windows)
- If this is your first time, you might see a welcome screen

### Step 2: Create a New Project
1. Click **"Select Project"** on the main screen
2. Click **"Create New Project"**
3. Enter a name for your project (e.g., "MyNovel", "ShortStories", "Memoir")
4. Click **"Create"**

### Step 3: Add Your Manuscript
You'll need to copy your manuscript file into the project folder:

**Option A: Using File Explorer/Finder**
1. Navigate to `~/writing_with_storygrind/YourProjectName/`
2. Copy your .txt or .docx file into this folder

**Option B: Using StoryGrind's Import Feature**
1. Click **"Import DOCX"** to convert a Word document to text
2. Follow the prompts to select and convert your file

## üîß Running Your First Tool

Let's start with something simple - counting words and tokens:

### Step 1: Select a Tool
1. In the **AI Tools** section, select **"Tokens & Words Counter"**
2. This tool analyzes your manuscript's length and complexity

### Step 2: Configure the Tool
1. Click **"Setup & Run"**
2. Choose your manuscript file from the dropdown
3. The tool will use your project folder as the save location

### Step 3: Run the Tool
1. Click **"Run Tool"**
2. Watch the progress in real-time
3. When finished, you'll see a list of generated files

### Step 4: View Results
1. Click on any generated file to open it in StoryGrind's built-in editor
2. Results are saved as timestamped .txt files in your project folder
3. You can also open these files with any text editor

## üìä Understanding Tool Results

Each tool creates detailed reports saved as text files:

**Example filename**: `tokens_words_counter_2024-01-15_143022.txt`
- `tokens_words_counter` = tool name
- `2024-01-15` = date run
- `143022` = time run (2:30:22 PM)

**What's inside**:
- Detailed analysis results
- Word counts by chapter
- Token usage information
- Recommendations and insights

## üé® Try More Tools

Now that you understand the basics, explore other tools:

### For New Writers
- **Developmental Editing** - Analyzes plot structure and pacing
- **Character Analyzer** - Tracks character development
- **Plot Thread Tracker** - Maps your story's plot lines

### For Revision Work
- **Line Editing** - Improves sentence-level writing
- **Copy Editing** - Fixes grammar and consistency
- **Tense Consistency Checker** - Catches tense shifts

### For Organization
- **Manuscript to Outline** - Extracts a detailed outline from your completed draft
- **Manuscript to Characters** - Creates character profiles from your story
- **Manuscript to World** - Builds world-building documents

## üìù Working with Results

### Reviewing Analysis
1. Read through each tool's report carefully
2. Look for patterns and recurring suggestions
3. Focus on issues that appear multiple times

### Making Edits
1. Open your original manuscript in your preferred editor (Word, Google Docs, etc.)
2. Use StoryGrind's reports as a guide for revisions
3. Work through suggestions systematically

### Re-running Tools
- After making edits, you can run tools again to see improvements
- Each run creates new timestamped files
- This helps you track your progress over time

## üîÑ Project Workflow

A typical StoryGrind workflow:

1. **Import** your manuscript
2. **Analyze** with broad tools (Developmental Editing, Narrative Integrity)
3. **Revise** your manuscript based on structural feedback
4. **Refine** with detailed tools (Line Editing, Copy Editing)
5. **Polish** with proofreading tools (Spelling, Punctuation)
6. **Repeat** as needed

## üí° Tips for Success

### Start Small
- Test tools on a single chapter first
- Get familiar with how each tool works
- Understand the results before processing your entire manuscript

### Use Non-AI Tools Too
- **Spell Checker** works without any API key
- **File conversion** tools are completely free
- These can handle basic tasks while you focus AI tools on complex analysis

### Customize Your Workspace
- Create different projects for different works
- Use descriptive project names
- Keep related works in separate projects

> Why It's Free Forever
> ---------------------
> This isn't a startup looking for users or a company planning to monetize later. 
> 
> I'm retired, I love books, and I wanted to help writers access AI editing without the usual tech industry nonsense. 
> 
> That's it. That's the business model, as in not one at all.
>
> If you find StoryGrind helpful, just tell another writer about it.

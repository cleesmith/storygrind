## TL;DR Quick Start

### Installing StoryGrind on Your Mac

#### Step 1: 
- Download StoryGrind at: https://github.com/cleesmith/storygrind/releases/latest
- Click on StoryGrind_Apple_silicon.dmg (not for Intel Mac's)
- Wait for download

#### Step 2: Install the App
- Find the downloaded .dmg file (probably in your Downloads folder)
- Double-click it
- Drag StoryGrind into the Applications folder
- Close the installer window

#### Step 3: Open StoryGrind for the First Time
- Open Finder, click Applications
- Double-click StoryGrind
- You'll see a dialog asking:
	"Are you sure you want to open it?"
	"Apple checked it for malicious software and none was detected"
	*This means StoryGrind was signed and notarized by Apple Developer Program*

> The security dialog is normal - it appears for all apps downloaded from the internet, even when Apple has verified them as safe. Always click "Open" when you see this message.

- Click "Open"
	StoryGrind will open and show a welcome screen asking you to choose an **AI provider**
	Pick one (highly recommned **OpenRouter**), and StoryGrind will tell you to restart the app
	It will also remind you that you need to add your API key to the **.env** file

> That's it! StoryGrind will now open like any other app.

### What StoryGrind Creates on Your Computer:
A **.env** file in your home folder where you'll put your API keys

## TL;DR -> Quick Start:

### Installing StoryGrind on Your Mac

#### Step 1: 
- Download StoryGrind at: https://github.com/cleesmith/storygrind/releases/latest
- Click on **StoryGrind_Apple_silicon.dmg** (not for Intel Mac's)
- Wait for download

#### Step 2: Install the App
- Find the downloaded StoryGrind_Apple_silicon.dmg file, probably in your **Downloads** folder
- Double-click it
- Drag **storygrind.app** into the **Applications** folder
- After dragging to Applications, close the installer window and eject

#### Step 3: Open StoryGrind for the First Time
- Open Finder, click Applications
- Double-click  **storygrind.app** 
- You'll see a dialog asking:
	"Are you sure you want to open it?"
	"*Apple checked it for malicious software and none was detected*"
	*This small print means StoryGrind was signed and notarized using the Apple Developer Program*

> The security dialog is normal - it appears for all apps downloaded from the internet, even when Apple has verified them as safe. So it's to click "Open" when you see this message.

- Click "Open"
	- StoryGrind will open and show a welcome screen asking you to choose an **AI provider**
	- Pick one (highly recommned **OpenRouter**), then click the blue button to quit and restart
	- It will also remind you that you need to add your API key to the **.env** file

> That's it! StoryGrind will now open like any other app.

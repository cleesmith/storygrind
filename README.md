# StoryGrind

StoryGrind is a desktop application that helps writers, authors, and editors analyze and improve their manuscripts using AI-powered tools. Your manuscripts stay on your computer, and you control when and how A.I. (AI) assistance is applied to your work.

## Why StoryGrind Exists

This isn't a startup looking for users or a company planning to monetize later. I'm retired, I love books, and I wanted to help writers access AI editing without the usual tech industry nonsense. That's it. That's the business model, as in not one at all.

If you find StoryGrind helpful, just tell another writer about it.

## Verification Option: Building from Source

*For writers who want to see exactly what code runs on their computer - like watching your meal being prepared in an open kitchen*:

**Fair warning**: This method involves using the command line, which can be intimidating if you've never done it before. Most writers prefer the pre-built downloads, which are created from this exact same code. Choose this path only if security verification is important enough to you to learn some technical skills.

**Note**: This method requires typing text commands instead of clicking buttons. It's more complex but gives you complete transparency.

### Steps:

1. **First, install Node.js** (this lets your computer understand JavaScript): https://nodejs.org/en/download
   - Choose the "LTS" version for your system
   - Run the installer just like any other program

2. **Get the StoryGrind source code**:
   - **Easier way**: Download ZIP from this page (green "Code" button above), then unzip
   - **Technical way**: Use `git clone https://github.com/cleesmith/storygrind.git`

3. **Open Terminal (Mac) or Command Prompt (Windows)**:
   - **Mac**: Find Terminal in Applications > Utilities
   - **Windows**: Search for "Command Prompt" in Start menu

4. **Navigate to the StoryGrind folder** by typing:
   ```
   cd storygrind
   ```
   *(This means "change directory to storygrind")*

5. **Install dependencies** by typing:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
   *(This downloads all the pieces StoryGrind needs to run - it may take a few minutes)*

6. **Start StoryGrind** by typing:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

### After the first time setup:
*Once you've done the above, starting StoryGrind is just:*

1. Open Terminal or Command Prompt
2. Type: `cd storygrind`
3. Type: `npm start`

### If you get stuck:
- The commands must be typed exactly as shown (computers are very literal)
- Make sure you're in the right folder - the terminal should show "storygrind" in its prompt
- Error messages often contain clues - don't panic, read them carefully
- Consider asking a tech-savvy friend for help - this is genuinely technical

Remember: The pre-built releases are created from this exact code. This verification option exists for those who prefer to confirm that themselves, but it's not necessary for safe use of StoryGrind.

# StoryGrind

StoryGrind is a desktop application that helps writers/authors/editors analyze and improve their manuscripts using AI-powered tools. Your manuscripts stay on your computer, and you control when and how A.I. (AI) assistance is applied to your work.

## Why StoryGrind Exists

This isn't a startup looking for users or a company planning to monetize later. I'm retired, I love books, and I wanted to help writers access AI editing without the usual tech industry nonsense. That's it. That's the business model, as in not one at all.

If you find StoryGrind helpful, just tell another writer about it.

StoryGrind version 6 - Your Own Private Publishing House

[play short Veo 3 video = logo]

INTRODUCTION

Hey everyone! 
Today I'm excited to show you one of the most powerful features in 
StoryGrind version 6 - the "Publish Manuscript" feature. 

Now, even though StoryGrind is really focused heavily on the editing of 
full manuscripts - that's its bread and butter - with the addition of 
this new publishing feature, it's become a complete publishing pipeline. 
It's a bit like having your own Random House - your own publishing house - 
with you totally in control from start to finish. 
Of course, promo and marketing is still on you, like always, but the 
entire production pipeline is now at your fingertips.

If you're an author who's tired of the complicated process of converting 
your manuscript into different formats, this is going to blow your mind. 
StoryGrind takes your plain text manuscript and transforms it into a 
complete published package - HTML for web reading, EPUB for e-readers, 
and even generates professional cover images. 
Let me show you exactly how it works.


SETTING THE SCENE

So here I have StoryGrind open on the main screen, and I've been 
working on my latest novel called "Spud" - it's about under estimating people. 
I've finished writing, done my editing, and now I'm ready to publish. 

[click on Finder icon]
You can see I have my manuscript.txt file here in the project. 
This is just a plain text file with my chapters, nothing fancy. 
No special formatting needed, no complex markup languages to learn. 
Just your story, written the way you want it.

STEP 1: SELECT PUBLISH MANUSCRIPT

First, on the main screen here, I'm going to select "Publish Manuscript" 
from the list of tools. There it is - I'll click on that to select it.

STEP 2: SETUP & RUN

Now I see the Setup & Run button appear. 
This is StoryGrind's two-step process that lets you configure 
everything before running the tool. 
I'll click on "Setup & Run".

STEP 3: CONFIGURATION WITH SETUP

Great! Now I'll click the "Setup" button. 
This opens the configuration window where I can set all my publishing options.

First, it's asking for the manuscript file - you can see it 
already has manuscript.txt as the default. 
That's perfect, so I'll leave that selected.

Next, it asks for the title. I can format this with semicolons if 
I want multiple lines on the cover. 
So I'll type "Spud; Endeavors to Persevere" - this will create a 
two-line title on my book cover. Semicolons are line dividers in titles.

Author name - I'll put my name here. 
This gets embedded in the metadata of both the HTML and EPUB files, 
which is great for proper attribution.

And here's something really cool - I can add a purchase URL. 
This creates a BUY button that links directly to wherever I'm 
selling my book - Amazon, my website, Gumroad, wherever. 
I'll add my book's Amazon link here.

Perfect! I'll click OK to use these settings for the next Run.

STEP 4: RUN THE PUBLISHER

Now comes the exciting part. 
I'll click the "Run" button and watch what happens...

Look at the output window! 
StoryGrind is working its magic and it's fast too. 
It's:
- Finding my manuscript.txt file
- Converting it to HTML with proper chapter navigation
- Generating a professional book cover image called cover.jpg (and .svg)
- Creating an EPUB file with embedded cover art and all the proper metadata
- Updating the books index page with my new publication

See those status messages flying by? 
It's creating the HTML version first, then the EPUB with the 
cover image embedded. 
Everything is being generated fresh from my source text.

STEP 5: THE 6-SECOND COUNTDOWN

And here's my favorite part - look at this message! 
See all those asterisks? 
StoryGrind is telling me:

"PUBLISHING COMPLETED"
"STANDBY, your web browser will open in:"
"-->>> 6 seconds <<<--"

The countdown lets you know exactly when you'll see your published work. 
No wondering if something went wrong, no manually searching for files. 
StoryGrind handles everything.

5... 4... 3... 2... 1...

THE PUBLISHED RESULT

Boom! 
My browser just opened automatically to the books index page, and 
there's my book - "Spud" - sitting right there with its 
semi-pro random geometric shapes cover images (both .svg and .jpg)!
And the correct size/shape for Amazon KDP and e-readers.

See those three buttons under the cover image? 
- HTML button - readers can click this to read my book directly in their browser
- EBOOK button - this downloads the EPUB file for e-readers
- BUY button - this takes anyone to your Amazon, or Book Funnel, or 
			   where ever page to purchase

Let me click on the HTML version... and there it is! 
My complete novel, formatted beautifully with chapter navigation, proper 
typography, and a reading experience that works on any device. 
Readers can enjoy this on their phone, tablet, or desktop.

ADDITIONAL FEATURES

Notice the dark mode toggle in the footer? 
Readers can switch between light and dark themes for 
comfortable reading any time of day. 
The page is also fully responsive - it adapts perfectly whether 
someone's reading on a massive desktop monitor or a small phone screen.

And if I go back to the index page, you'll see how it 
organizes multiple books. As I publish more manuscripts, they all 
appear here in this beautiful grid layout. 
It's like having your own personal bookstore!

THE COMPLETE WORKFLOW RECAP

So let's recap the workflow:
1. First, select a wrting Project
2. Select "Publish Manuscript" under "Run a non-AI tool:"
3. Click "Setup & Run"
4. Click "Setup" and enter: title, author, and purchase link
5. Click "Run" to start the publishing process
6. Wait 6 seconds for your browser to automatically open and 
   show your published book

That's it! 
Six simple steps from manuscript to published book.
Well, published locally on your computer, in a future video 
we will see how to publish your books for free using 
Github Pages. Of course, if you already have a website you 
copy these published files to there as well.

UNPUBLISHING OPTION

Oh, and if you ever need to remove a book - maybe for a revision or 
if you've sold exclusive rights somewhere - StoryGrind has you covered. 
Just select "Publish Manuscript" again, but in the Setup, there's an 
unpublish option that cleanly removes your book from the index 
while keeping all your files safe in your project folder.
It only removes the book from the index.html page.

THE AUTHOR'S ADVANTAGE

Think about what just happened here. 
In just six simple steps, I went from a plain text manuscript 
to a professionally published book available in multiple formats. 
No expensive software, no complex conversion tools, no hiring formatters. 
Just Setup & Run and you're done.

This is perfect for:
- Self-published authors who want professional results
- Writers who can not afford Vellum just to publish an ebook
- Writers testing different versions of their work
- Anyone creating anthologies or short story collections
- Authors who want to share preview chapters with beta readers
- Writers building their own digital bookshelf

WRAPPING UP

And that's the Publish Manuscript feature in StoryGrind version 6! 
From manuscript to published book in seconds with a simple 
Setup & Run workflow. 
Your readers get a beautiful reading experience, you get 
professional formats without the hassle, and everyone wins.

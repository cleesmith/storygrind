=== IMPORTANT ===
3 POV characters
Multiple cases that seem separate but connect
Way more moral ambiguity
The three cops spending more time hunting each other
A darker, more cynical ending

For your structure specifically:
The book shows how to have three protagonists who are all "right" from 
their own perspective, investigating the same crime while also 
investigating/suspecting each other. 
Each chapter you're deeper in one pov's head, seeing the others 
as potential enemies.

Use these techniques:

Short, punchy chapters that rotate POVs
Each character misreading the others' motives
Information revealed to one POV but not others
Everyone keeping secrets while hunting truth

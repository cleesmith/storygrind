 Tips for getting started:

 1. Run /init to create a CLAUDE.md file with instructions for Claude
 2. Use Claude to help with file analysis, editing, bash commands and git
 3. Be as specific as you would with another engineer for the best results
 4. ✔ Run /terminal-setup to set up terminal integration

 ※ Tip: Use /permissions to pre-approve and pre-deny bash, edit, and MCP tools

> /init is analyzing your codebase…

     This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this
     repository.
     ## Project Overview
     StoryGrind is an Electron-based desktop application for creative fiction writers that
     provides AI-powered manuscript analysis and editing tools. The app uses multiple AI
     providers (Gemini, OpenAI, Claude) and stores user projects locally in
     `~/writing_with_storygrind/`.
     ## Development Commands
     … +87 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ I've analyzed the StoryGrind codebase and created a comprehensive CLAUDE.md file that
  captures the essential information for future Claude instances. The file includes:

  Development Commands: All the npm scripts needed for building, packaging, and running the
  application.

  Architecture Overview: The key components including the Electron main/renderer processes, AI
  integration layer, tool system, and project management structure.

  Key Patterns: Important development patterns for tool creation, API provider management, IPC
  communication, and state management.

  Security Considerations: How the app handles API keys, file access restrictions, and user
  data protection.

  The file focuses on the "big picture" architecture that requires understanding multiple
  files, rather than listing every component or obvious development practices. This should help
   future Claude instances quickly understand how to work effectively with this AI-powered
  writing tool application.

     156 
     157  ### High Costs
     158  - Check which tools you're using (some analyze entire manuscripts)
     159  - Consider switching to Gemini for lower costs
     160  - Use shorter test documents first
     161  
     157  ## 🎯 Next Steps

     ## 🆓 About StoryGrind
     ### Is StoryGrind really free?
     Yes! StoryGrind itself is completely free and open source. However, AI-powered tools
     require an API key from a provider (Google, Anthropic, or OpenAI), and those providers
     charge for usage. Non-AI tools (spell check, file conversion) work without any API key.
     ### What file formats does StoryGrind support?
     StoryGrind works with `.txt` and `.docx` files. It can also convert between these formats.
     All output files are saved as `.txt` for maximum compatibility.

  🔍 Review Process

  You can review all content locally in the wiki-content/ folder. Each .md file can be opened
  in any text editor or markdown viewer.

  📚 Still Needed (Optional)

  The pages I created cover the essentials, but you might want to add:
  - User interface guide
  - Troubleshooting guide
  - Best practices
  - Advanced workflow tips

  Would you like me to create any of these additional pages, or would you prefer to review what
   we have first before proceeding to GitHub?

> can i come back later for those, if needed, pages ?

⏺ Absolutely! The pages I've created cover all the essentials that writers need to get started
  and use StoryGrind effectively. You can definitely come back later to add the optional pages
  if you find users are asking for them.

  The core foundation is solid:
  - Home - Gets people oriented
  - Installation - Gets the app running
  - API Setup - Gets AI features working
  - Getting Started - Gets first project created
  - AI Tools Guide - Explains what each tool does
  - FAQ - Answers common questions

  You now have everything in the wiki-content/ folder ready to review. When you're ready to
  publish to GitHub:

  1. Review the content locally
  2. Create a Wiki on your GitHub repo
  3. Copy the content from each .md file into new GitHub Wiki pages
  4. Test the internal links

  This gives you a complete, writer-friendly wiki that matches your app's approachable tone
  without getting into cost comparisons. Perfect for helping writers get the most out of
  StoryGrind!

> so now locally how do i view the wiki

⏺ You have several options to view the wiki content locally:

  🔍 Simple Text Editor

  Open any .md file in:
  - Mac: TextEdit, BBEdit, or any text editor
  - Windows: Notepad, Notepad++, or any text editor
  - You'll see the raw markdown, but it's readable

  📖 Markdown Viewer (Recommended)

  Option 1: Visual Studio Code (Free)

  1. Download https://code.visualstudio.com/ if you don't have it
  2. Open the wiki-content folder in VS Code
  3. Click any .md file
  4. Press Ctrl+Shift+V (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+V (Mac) to preview
  5. You'll see it formatted like a real webpage

  Option 2: Typora (Paid but nice)

  - Download https://typora.io/
  - Opens markdown files in a beautiful formatted view

  Option 3: Browser Extension

  - Install a markdown viewer browser extension
  - Open the .md files in your browser to see them formatted

  🚀 Quick Start

  The easiest way right now:

⏺ Bash(ls -la wiki-content/)
  ⎿ No (tell Claude what to do differently)

> i use Sublime Text, can i view them there?

⏺ Yes! Sublime Text can view the markdown files, though you'll 
  see the raw markdown syntax rather than formatted output.

  To view in Sublime Text:

  1. Open Sublime Text
  2. File > Open Folder and select the wiki-content folder
  3. You'll see all the .md files in the sidebar
  4. Click any file to open it

  📖 What You'll See

  - The content will be readable but with markdown syntax visible
  - # Headings will show with the # symbols
  - **bold text** will show with the asterisks
  - Links will show as [text](url) format

  🎨 Better Viewing in Sublime Text

  For nicer markdown viewing in Sublime:

  1. Install Package Control (if you don't have it)
  2. Install "MarkdownPreview" package:
    - Ctrl+Shift+P (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+P (Mac)
    - Type "Package Control: Install Package"
    - Search for "MarkdownPreview"
    - Install it
  3. Preview any markdown file:
    - Open a .md file
    - Ctrl+Shift+P and type "Markdown Preview"
    - Choose "Preview in Browser"
    - It will open formatted in your browser

  Even without the preview package, the raw markdown in Sublime Text is quite readable - you'll
   be able to review all the content easily!

> what if i just git push the repo and view them on github?  i know they won't be a wiki yet

⏺ That's actually a great idea! GitHub automatically renders markdown files beautifully when
  you view them in the repository.

  If you push the repo with the wiki-content/ folder:

  ✅ What You'll Get

  - All .md files will be nicely formatted when viewed on GitHub
  - Clickable links, proper headings, styled text
  - Easy navigation between files
  - Professional appearance identical to how they'd look in the wiki

  📁 GitHub View

  - Go to https://github.com/yourusername/storygrind/tree/main/wiki-content
  - Click any .md file (like Home.md)
  - GitHub renders it perfectly formatted
  - Links between pages won't work yet (since they're wiki-style links)

  🔗 Link Issue

  The internal links like [Getting Started](Getting-Started) won't work in the repo view
  because they're formatted for GitHub Wiki. But you can easily:
  - Read all the content
  - See how it looks formatted
  - Navigate by going back and clicking other files

  🚀 Quick Process

  1. git add wiki-content/
  2. git commit -m "Add wiki content for review"
  3. git push
  4. Browse to your repo and click into the wiki-content folder

  This is actually easier than setting up markdown viewers locally, and you'll see exactly how
  the content will look when it becomes a real wiki!

> i can remove it after viewing ... but if all is ok, what's the steps to really make the 
  github wiki

⏺ Exactly! You can remove the wiki-content/ folder from the repo after reviewing. Here's how to
   create the actual GitHub Wiki:

  🚀 Creating the Real GitHub Wiki

  Step 1: Enable Wiki on Your Repo

  1. Go to your GitHub repository
  2. Click Settings tab
  3. Scroll down to Features section
  4. Check the box for "Wikis"
  5. Click Save

  Step 2: Access Your Wiki

  1. You'll now see a Wiki tab next to Code, Issues, etc.
  2. Click the Wiki tab
  3. GitHub will show "Welcome to the [repo name] wiki!"

  Step 3: Create the Home Page

  1. Click "Create the first page"
  2. The page name will default to "Home" (perfect!)
  3. Copy content from your Home.md file
  4. Paste it into the editor
  5. Click "Save Page"

  Step 4: Create Additional Pages

  For each remaining file:
  1. Click "New Page" in the wiki
  2. Use the filename without .md as the page name:
    - Installation-Guide.md → page name: Installation-Guide
    - API-Setup-Guide.md → page name: API-Setup-Guide
    - etc.
  3. Copy the content from each file
  4. Save each page

  Step 5: Test Navigation

  - All the internal links like [Installation Guide](Installation-Guide) should now work
  - Click through to make sure navigation flows properly

  🧹 Cleanup After

  Once your wiki is working:
  1. git rm -r wiki-content/
  2. git commit -m "Remove wiki content folder (now in GitHub Wiki)"
  3. git push

  💡 Pro Tips

  - Page names in GitHub Wiki are case-sensitive
  - Use the exact names from your links (like Installation-Guide)
  - You can always edit pages later if you find issues
  - GitHub Wiki has its own git repository if you want to clone it locally later

  The whole process takes about 15-20 minutes once you're happy with the content!
